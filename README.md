# Clarifai Demo CLI

This is a very simple package that takes an image URL and tells you what's in the image using [Clarifai](https://www.clarifai.com/)!

## Getting Started

1. [Grab an API key from Clarifai.](https://www.clarifai.com/developer/guide/authentication#authentication)
2. Call the CLI as follows: `CLARIFAI_KEY=<your-key> npx @dannycjones/clarifai-demo <image-url>`

This is only meant to highlight how easy it can be to include an authenticated API in your projects. Even this is more complicated than it needs to be.
